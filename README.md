# Go

---

### 📅 Day 1

- Every go package has main function that ack like main in C or C++
- Go program run started from main function
- Command for run function in other file

### 📅 Day 2

- Looping in go done through 'for' keyword
- There are no 'while' and 'do while' in go, but those two statement replaced with 'for'
- 'for' loop with 'range' results index and item from the given iterator
- TL;DR looping == 'for'

```go
go run main.go other.go
```
